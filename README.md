Contains training materials beyond the documentation

This is the repository for materials other than the UserGuide to help people learn to use CogTool.

CogTool_Course contains the PowerPoint source of course notes for a 3-hour course that introduces 
the concept of predictive human performance modeling for UI design and evaluation and demonstrates
how to use CogTool for this purpose. It contains the materials necessary to do a comparison of 
three UIs for collaborative shopping, plus the answers to that exercise.

Other mateials will appear as they are created.
